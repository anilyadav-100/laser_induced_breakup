## 🧪 Investigated Liquids & Properties
| Liquid   | Boiling Point (°C) | Viscosity (mPa·s) | Surface Tension (mN/m) |
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Ethanol  | 78                 | 1.2               | 22                      |
| n-Decane | 174                | 0.92              | 24                      |
| Xylene   | 140                | 0.65              | 28                      |

## 🔍 Key Observations
- **Ethanol** → Rapid vaporization & mist-like breakup due to low boiling point.  
- **Decane** → Subtle ruptures and instabilities caused by lower viscosity and surface tension.  
- **Xylene** → Delayed but intense breakup, forming bag-like sheets and ligaments due to higher IR absorption and boiling point.  
- Breakup **intensity and timing scale with laser power** → higher power → faster & more violent breakup.

## 📊 Conclusion
- Demonstrated **laser-induced breakup of acoustically levitated droplets** with clear dependence on **fluid properties and laser power**.  
- Highlighted mechanisms: **thermal heating, vaporization, pressure buildup, deformation, ligament formation, and fragmentation**.  
- Established baseline for applications in **nanolithography, semiconductor cleaning, and microfluidics**.
